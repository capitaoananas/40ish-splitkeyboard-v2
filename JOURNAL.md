# May 30th: Started making the actuall project + a bit of reserch!

First im deciding if i should use a Xiao nrf or a nice nano v2 so i started testing which one would work better for my keyboard design also im going to use in this version solder jumpers so that the reversing part works better.

**Total time spent: 1:30h**

# June 1st: Getting the rest of the schematic done!

I think that im going to use the nice nano as its easier to make the pcb and schematic because the xiao-nrf-plus does not have a symbol to use in the schematic so most of the work would be on the PCB editor and that would take more work and its just not so pretty and organized.

Got almost almost the schematic done but its quite hard!

**Total time spent: 1h**

# June 2nd: Schematic done and PCB almost!

## Today i made the schematic untill the end! Which is really cool one more step into being done!

**in the schematic i:**
  - Wired the rest of the pins!
  - Added rotary encoder with a switch which they are going to be one on top of each other becase like that you can choose between a extra switch or rotary encoder which is a ec11 which has a switch so you are only winning with the rotary encoder.

Here is a photo of the schematic finnished!

Then in the PCB i also did a great part of it!

**in the PCB i**
  - Wired the solder jumpers which was time consuming even tought it does not look like.

  - Arranged the keys in the layout that i really like.
  - Added the edge cuts.
  - Somehow the switch and the rotary encoder work really well when they are one on top of each other

also here is the rotary encoder

**Total time spent: 3h**

# June 3rd: PCB almost done! Added mounting holes and put the nice nano inside the PCB.

Today i added mounting holes into the PCB for the screws also then i already added the Nice nano and the rotary encoder to the PCB and routed some of the connections but that is one of the last things i have to do in the PCB route it all so the PCB is ready!

While i was making the PCB i saw that the bridge jumpers where filped so they where not in the right direction and then i started remaking it so it was right side up but in the middle of that i realized that actually like that it was better so i actually made something better accidently!
